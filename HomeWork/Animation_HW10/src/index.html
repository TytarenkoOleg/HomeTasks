        </div>

        <p>The Mercedes-AMG GT (C190 / R190) is a 2-door, 2-seat sports car produced in coupé and roadster form by
            Mercedes-AMG. The car was introduced on 9 September 2014 and was officially unveiled to the public in
            October 2014 at the Paris Motor Show.[4] After the SLS AMG, it is the second sports car developed entirely
            in-house by Mercedes-AMG. The Mercedes-AMG GT went on sale in two variants (GT and GT S) in March 2015,
            while a GT3 racing variant of the car was introduced in 2015. A GT4 racing variant, targeted at
            semi-professional drivers and based on the GT R variant, was introduced in 2017. All variants are assembled
            at the Mercedes-Benz plant in Sindelfingen, Germany.</p>

        <h3>Specifications</h3>
        <p>The GT uses a front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, with the engine positioned inside of the vehicle's
            wheelbase. The spaceframe chassis and body are made out of aluminium alloys, while the boot lid is steel and
            the bonnet is made of magnesium.[4] The suspension system is a double wishbone unit at the front and rear,
            with forged aluminium wishbones and hub carriers.</p>

        <p>The car is powered by a front-mid mounted M178 4-litre twin-turbo V8 engine. The engine is in "hot inside V"
            configuration—with exhaust manifolds and turbochargers inside the cylinder banks to reduce turbo lag—and
            uses dry-sump lubrication. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a 7-speed AMG SPEEDSHIFT dual-clutch
            transmission; the GT S variant employs an electronically controlled mechanical limited-slip
            differential.[12] In a road test executed by Car and Driver, the GT S accelerated from 0–60 mph in 3.0
            seconds and completed the quarter mile in 11.2 seconds and attained a top speed of 193 mph (311 km/h).</p>
